Spoons

Goal: Grab a spoon before there are no more left

Rules/ How to Play:
Must be 3-13 players
Shuffle cards thoroughly
Players get into one circle 
Place one less spoon in the middle or the circle than there are players
Designate one person to be the dealer
The dealer will give each player 4 cards from the deck
Each person starts out with 4 cards and must only have 4 cards in their hand at all times besides the one card they are about to replace
The dealer will begin to pick up one card at a time from the remains of the deck and if they decide they want to keep that card, they must pass on a different card from their hand to the player to their left’s space (resulting in having 4 cards)
If they don’t want to keep that card, they must pass it to their left 
The next player will pick up the cards one at a time, and like the dealer, must do steps 7-8
The player directly right of the dealer does not pass its unwanted cards to the left
Instead, they will put them into a pile designated the “Trash Pile” and those cards are no longer circulated through the circle
The players will continue to go through steps 7-11 until someone in the group gets a four of a kind or the cards run out
If the cards run out, the dealer will uses the “Trash Pile” as if it were the remaining deck
If someone gets a four of a kind, that player will stop circulating the cards and grab one of the spoons in the middle of the circle
PLAYERS CAN ONLY GRAB THE FIRST SPOON IF THEY HAVE A FOUR OF A KIND
Once the first spoon is grabbed, every other player will try and take the remaining spoons before they are gone, regardless if they have a four of a kind or not
If the spoons run out, the person remaining spoonless will be out of the game
Players will repeat steps 2-16 until there is only one player with a spoon once the rounds are over
The last player with the last spoon wins the game
